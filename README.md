### 🌟 About Me
I’m a learner in the **ALX Front-End Web Development** programme. I started with software engineering because **I believe technology is a powerful tool to create, inspire, and solve real problems. Coming from an educational background, I have seen firsthand how access to the right tools can transform lives. This fuels my passion to merge creativity with logic, designing interfaces that not only work but also make learning and everyday interactions easier.** I’m passionate about **building solutions that blend education and technology, making knowledge more accessible to students and communities. What inspires me is seeing ideas come alive on the web, and knowing that what I build can directly impact people’s growth and success. Stories of self-taught developers who grew into world-class engineers remind me that consistency and curiosity can take me far.**


My goal is to **become a unique frontend engineer who leverages design, problem-solving, and creativity to bring lasting value to people and society.**, so I’m currently focusing on projects like **Landing Pages**.


- 🌱 I’m learning: **HTML · CSS · JavaScript · Git · React (ALX Front‑End)**
- 💡 Interests: **Accessible UI, Education Tech, Practical UX**
- 🤝 Open to: **Open‑source, internships, freelance front‑end gigs**
